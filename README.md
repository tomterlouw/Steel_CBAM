# `Steel_CBAM`

`Steel_CBAM` is a repository designed to quantify the climate-effectiveness of the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) for the global steel industry. It combines (prospective) life cycle assessment (LCA) with regionalized production data. The code was developed in the context of project TRANSIENCE (see Acknowledgements).

## How to use it

The workflow is structured in five main Jupyter Notebooks:

### `0_set_up_lca_db_gen_acts.ipynb`
Generates prospective LCA databases using the [`premise`](https://github.com/polca/premise) framework. These databases reflect different technological and energy transformation pathways.

### `1_steel_dbs_setup.ipynb`
Configures region-specific steel production routes using the databases.

### `2_steel_assessment.ipynb`
Performs the main CBAM assessment by first creating new databases and then calculating environmental impacts under various scenarios, regions, and timeframes. 

### `3_create_additional_prospective_regionalized_dbs.ipynb`
Generates additional prospective LCA databases for REMIND with regionalization to REMIND regions.

### `4_create_additional_figs_REMIND.ipynb` and `5_create_sensitivity_figs.ipynb`
Optional notebooks to generate advanced visualizations based on IAM pathways and sensitivity assumptions.

 *Each notebook includes markdown cells that explain assumptions, code logic, and visualization steps.*

## Dependencies

To run the notebooks, you need the following:

- `KEY_PREMISE`: API key for using the `premise` framework.
- `USER_PW`: Username and password for access to the **ecoinvent** LCA database.

Install the required environment with:

```bash
conda env create -f bw_env_hydrogen.yml
conda activate bw_reg_prem
```

---

## Output & documentation

- Results from the assessments are saved in the `results/` folders.
- High-resolution visualizations are available in the `figs/` folder.
- All notebooks are extensively documented and structured for reproducibility.

Use the outputs to:

- Evaluate CBAM policy impact across world regions
- Compare multiple LCA indicators (e.g., climate change impacts and water consumption)
- Analyze different future scenarios and sensitivity cases
